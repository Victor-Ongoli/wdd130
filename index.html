            Hello! My name is Victor Ongoli and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. One thing I really like doing is reading
            books and spending time with my family. I am currently studying website development as an overall path
            to being an software enginner in BYU Idaho, am looking forward to creating wonderful websites and
            software in the future.
